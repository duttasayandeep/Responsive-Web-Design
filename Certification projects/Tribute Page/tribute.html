        <h3 id="headline">Achievements of Dr.John Forbes Nash Jr. during his lifetime:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Nash earned a PhD in <strong>1950</strong> with a 28-page dissertation on non-cooperative games.The thesis, written under the supervision of doctoral advisor Albert W. Tucker, contained the definition and properties of the Nash equilibrium, a crucial concept in non-cooperative games. A version of his thesis was published a year later in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_Mathematics">Annals of Mathematics.</a></li>

  <li>In <strong>1949</strong>, while still a graduate student, Nash found a new result in the mathematical field of real algebraic geometry.He announced his theorem in a contributed paper at the International Congress of Mathematicians in <strong>1950</strong>, although he had not yet worked out the details of its proof.Nash's theorem was finalized by October 1951, when Nash submitted his work to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annals_of_Mathematics">Annals of Mathematics.</a></li>
  
  <li>During his postdoctoral position at MIT, Nash was eager to find high-profile mathematical problems to study.Nash's first embedding theorem was found in <strong>1953.</strong></li>
  
</ul>
<h3 id="headline">Mental Illness of Dr.John Forbes Nash Jr.:</h3>
<p>Although Nash's mental illness first began to manifest in the form of <strong>paranoia</strong>, his wife later described his behavior as erratic. Nash's psychological issues crossed into his professional life when he gave an American Mathematical Society lecture at Columbia University in early <strong>1959</strong>. Originally intended to present proof of the Riemann hypothesis, the lecture was incomprehensible. Colleagues in the audience immediately realized that something was wrong. </p>

<p>In April <strong>1959</strong>, Nash was admitted to McLean Hospital for one month. Based on his paranoid, persecutory delusions, hallucinations, and increasing asociality, he was diagnosed with <b>schizophrenia.</b></p>
<h3 id="headline">Death:</h3>
<p>On <strong>May 23, 2015</strong>, Nash and his wife died in a car accident on the New Jersey Turnpike near Exit 8A in Monroe Township, New Jersey. After a visit to Norway, where Nash had received the Abel Prize, they had made arrangements to be picked up by a limo at Newark Airport. But because of a change in flight plans at the last minute they arrived five hours earlier, and had to take a taxi instead.Their taxicab driver, Tarek Girgis, lost control of the vehicle and struck a guardrail.</p>
